# cleans up the rig to make it cleaner for animation to see.

either use blackboxing or hidden in outliner
if hidden in outliner wire it up to a single debug control we can flip on and off when debugging the rig.
set ihi for all meshes
set reference and drawing overrides for the top level geom.  Also connect drawing overrides to the debug control.
make sure all fitting shapes on buffers are turned off. 




Have a button that you can use to set up scaling of the control. It adds a cluster to scale a curve and then later delete history...



Fitting guides.  Line_Width
