'''
this package is meant for half-baked, ideas to be stored and tested before they are rolled out
different theories or practices should be tested here
ideas, concepts, are also encouraged

ideas that help us simplify, standardize, and optimize are very encouraged

try to keep your code non destructive
don't worry about code reviews until rolling into production bdp packages.

I would recommend users to create their own packages with their usernames to keep their personal code organized.

have fun!
